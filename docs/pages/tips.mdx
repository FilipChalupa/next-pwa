# Tips

1. [Common UX pattern to ask user to reload when new service worker is installed](https://github.com/ImBIOS/next-pwa/blob/master/examples/lifecycle/pages/index.js#L26-L38)
2. Use a convention like `{command: 'doSomething', message: ''}` object when `postMessage` to service worker. So that on the listener, it could do multiple different tasks using `if...else...`.
3. When you are debugging service worker, constantly `clean application cache` to reduce some flaky errors.
4. If you are redirecting the user to another route, please note [workbox by default only cache response with 200 HTTP status](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/modules/workbox-cacheable-response#what_are_the_defaults), if you really want to cache redirected page for the route, you can specify it in `runtimeCaching` such as `options.cacheableResponse.statuses=[200,302]`.
5. When debugging issues, you may want to format your generated `sw.js` file to figure out what's really going on.
6. Force `next-pwa` to generate worker box production build by specify the option `mode: 'production'` in your `pwa` section of `next.config.js`. Though `next-pwa` automatically generate the worker box development build during development (by running `next`) and worker box production build during production (by running `next build` and `next start`). You may still want to force it to production build even during development of your web app for following reason:
   1. Reduce logging noise due to production build doesn't include logging.
   2. Improve performance a bit due to production build is optimized and minified.
7. If you just want to disable worker box logging while keeping development build during development, [simply put `self.__WB_DISABLE_DEV_LOGS = true` in your `worker/index.js` (create one if you don't have one)](https://github.com/shadowwalker/next-pwa/blob/c48ef110360d0138ad2dacd82ab96964e3da2daf/examples/custom-worker/worker/index.js#L6).
8. It is common developers have to use `userAgent` string to determine if users are using Safari/iOS/MacOS or some other platform, [ua-parser-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ua-parser-js) library is a good friend for that purpose.
