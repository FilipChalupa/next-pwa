# Configuration

There are options you can use to customize the behavior of this plugin by adding `pwa` object in the next config in `next.config.js`:

```js title="next.config.js" copy
const withPWA = require("@imbios/next-pwa")({
  dest: "public",
  // disable: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
  // register: true,
  // scope: '/app',
  // sw: 'service-worker.js',
  //...
});

module.exports = withPWA({
  // next.js config
});
```

### Available Options

- disable: boolean - whether to disable pwa feature as a whole
  - default: `false`
  - set `disable: false`, so that it will generate service worker in both `dev` and `prod`
  - set `disable: true` to completely disable PWA
  - if you don't need to debug service worker in `dev`, you can set `disable: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'`
- register: boolean - whether to let this plugin register service worker for you
  - default to `true`
  - set to `false` when you want to handle register service worker yourself, this could be done in `componentDidMount` of your root app. you can consider the [register.js](https://github.com/ImBIOS/next-pwa/blob/master/register.js) as an example.
- scope: string - url scope for pwa
  - default: [`basePath`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/basepath) in `next.config.js` or `/`
  - set to `/app` so that path under `/app` will be PWA while others are not
- sw: string - service worker script file name
  - default: `/sw.js`
  - set to another file name if you want to customize the output file name
- runtimeCaching - caching strategies (array or callback function)
  - default: see the **Runtime Caching** section for the default configuration
  - accepts an array of cache entry objects, [please follow the structure here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/reference/workbox-build/#type-RuntimeCaching)
  - Note: the order of the array matters. The first rule that matches is effective. Therefore, please **ALWAYS** put rules with larger scope behind the rules with a smaller and specific scope.
- publicExcludes - an array of glob pattern strings to exclude files in the `public` folder from being precached.
  - default: `['!noprecache/**/*']` - this means that the default behavior will precache all the files inside your `public` folder but files inside `/public/noprecache` folder. You can simply put files inside that folder to not precache them without config this.
  - example: `['!img/super-large-image.jpg', '!fonts/not-used-fonts.otf']`
- buildExcludes - an array of extra pattern or function to exclude files from being precached in `.next/static` (or your custom build) folder
  - default: `[]`
  - example: `[/chunks\/images\/.*$/]` - Don't precache files under `.next/static/chunks/images` (Highly recommend this to work with `next-optimized-images` plugin)
  - doc: Array of (string, RegExp, or function()). One or more specifiers used to exclude assets from the precache manifest. This is interpreted following the same rules as Webpack's standard exclude option.
- cacheStartUrl - whether to cache start url
  - default: `true`
  - [discussion of use case to not cache start url at all](https://github.com/shadowwalker/next-pwa/pull/296#issuecomment-1094167025)
- dynamicStartUrl - if your start url returns different HTML document under different state (such as logged in vs. not logged in), this should be set to true.
  - default: `true`
  - effective when `cacheStartUrl` set to `true`
  - recommend: set to **false** if your start url always returns same HTML document, then start url will be precached, this will help to speed up first load.
- dynamicStartUrlRedirect - if your start url redirect to another route such as `/login`, it's recommended to setup this redirected url for the best user experience.
  - default: `undefined`
  - effective when `dynamicStartUrlRedirect` set to `true`
- fallbacks - config precached routes to fallback when both cache and network not available to serve resources.
  - **if you just need a offline fallback page, simply create a `/_offline` page such as `pages/_offline.js` and you are all set, no configuration necessary**
  - default: `object`
    - `fallbacks.document` - fallback route for document (page), default to `/_offline` if you created that page
    - `fallbacks.image` - fallback route for image, default to none
    - `fallbacks.audio` - fallback route for audio, default to none
    - `fallbacks.video` - fallback route for video, default to none
    - `fallbacks.font` - fallback route for font, default to none
- cacheOnFrontEndNav - enable additional route cache when navigate between pages with `next/link` on front end. Checkout this [example](https://github.com/ImBIOS/next-pwa/tree/master/examples/cache-on-front-end-nav) for some context about why this is implemented.
  - default: `false`
  - note: this improve user experience on special use cases but it also adds some overhead because additional network call, I suggest you consider this as a trade off.
- ~~subdomainPrefix: string - url prefix to allow hosting static files on a subdomain~~
  - ~~default: `""` - i.e. default with no prefix~~
  - ~~example: `/subdomain` if the app is hosted on `example.com/subdomain`~~
  - deprecated, use [basePath](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/basepath) instead
- reloadOnOnline - changes the behaviour of the app when the device detects that it has gone back "online" and has a network connection. Indicate if the app should call `location.reload()` to refresh the app.
  - default: `true`
- customWorkerDir - customize the directory where `next-pwa` looks for a custom worker implementation to add to the service worker generated by workbox. For more information, check out the [custom worker example](https://github.com/ImBIOS/next-pwa/tree/master/examples/custom-ts-worker).
  - default: `worker`
- customWorkerWebpack - Function to customize the webpack configuration for bundling custom workers. Receives the configuration object with default settings and must return the modified one.
  - default: `undefined`

### Other Options

`next-pwa` uses `workbox-webpack-plugin`, other options which could also be put in `pwa` object can be found [**ON THE DOCUMENTATION**](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin) for [GenerateSW](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin/#generatesw-plugin) and [InjectManifest](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin/#injectmanifest-plugin). If you specify `swSrc`, `InjectManifest` plugin will be used, otherwise `GenerateSW` will be used to generate service worker.

### Runtime Caching

`next-pwa` uses a default runtime [cache.js](https://github.com/ImBIOS/next-pwa/blob/master/cache.js)

There is a great chance you may want to customize your own runtime caching rules. Please feel free to copy the default `cache.js` file and customize the rules as you like. Don't forget to inject the configurations into your `pwa` config in `next.config.js`.

Here is the [document on how to write runtime caching configurations](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/reference/workbox-build/#type-RuntimeCaching), including background sync and broadcast update features and more!
